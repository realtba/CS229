# CS229

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments of the autumn 2016 version of the Stanford university course CS229:
 Machine Learning.

Problem Set 1

LogisticRegressionWithNewton.py: an implementation of logistic regression using Newton's method to fit the parameters.

Regression.py:  an implementation of linear and weighted linear regression using the normal equations to calculate the 
parameters.

ProblemSet2:

naivebayes.py/naivebayes.ipynb: spam classification using the naive bayes algorithm. Note: The error for small feature sets is unexpected large. It is not clear if the problem is due to an error from translating the load matrix function from the provided matlab implementation to python or if my naive bayes algorithm implementation is bugged.
